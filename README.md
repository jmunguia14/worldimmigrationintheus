A data visualization project about world immigration in the U.S. Maps come from Highcharts.com and data comes from US census(2015) and World bank data.
This is a project I developed during my summer internship at University of Massachussets Dartmouth.
My advisor was Dr.David Koop, Computer Science Professor at UMD. 


Features:

  - Clik in a country of the world map and see how many people from that country live in each state in the U.S - Interactive maps.  
  -Clik in a state and see where those people came from in the world map- Interactive maps.
  - Use the single U.S maps to see how many immigrants from the world live in that state and the % out the total population.
